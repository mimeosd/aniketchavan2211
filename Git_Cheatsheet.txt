#                          Git & Github
#1 Introduction of Git    
   
   Git is a version control system for tracking changes in 
   computer files and cordinating work on those files among 
   multiple people.
  
   Github is a provider of Internet hosting for software 
   deveploment and version control using Git. It offers the 
   distributed version control and source code management
   functionality of Git.

   Bitbucket is a Git based source code repository hosting
   service. Bitbucked offers both commercial plans and tree
   accounts with an unlimited number of private repositories.
 
   Gitlab is a open - core company that provides Gitlab a 
   DevOps software package that combines the ability to 
   develop, secure, and operate software in a single
   applaiction. 

#2 Your Identity
   
   Configuring Name & Email in Git
   
   "git config" that lets you get and set configuration
    variables that control all aspects of how Git looks and 
    operates.

   The first thing you should do when you install Git is to set 
   your username and email address.

    >_ git config --global user.name "Username"
    >_ git config --global user.email "Email"

   you need to do this only if you pass the "--global" option,
   because then Git will always use that infomation for anything
   you do on that system.
  
   Checking the Username & Email:
    
    >_ git config --global user.name 
    >_ git config --global user.email

#3 Initializing Git Repository or Reinitializing an exiting one 
    
   git init - {create an empty Git repository or reinitialize an 
               exiting one.}  
   
   Description
    
    This command creates an empty Git repository basically a 
    ".git" directory with subdirectories for object, 
    refs/heads, refs/tags, and template files.

    #Setup for SSH for Git 
     
     ssh-keygen - {you can create a new public and private 
                   key pair with the following command, Enter 
                   and re-enter a passphrase when prompted, or 
                   leave it empty.

     eval "$(ssh-agent -s)" - {Add you SSH key to the ssh-agent. 
                               Notice that you'll need te 
                               replace id_rsa in the command 
                               with the name of your private key 
                               file}
     
     ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa  - {Key}

#4 Staging Area
   Unlike the other systems, Git has something called the 
   "staging area" or "index". This is an intermediate area 
   where commits can be formatted and reviewed before 
   completing the commit.
     
   Working Directory > UnModified > Modified > Staging Area > 
   
   Remote Repository 

#5 Git Add Command
   
   The git add command adds content from the working directory
   into the staging area (or “index”) for the next commit. 
   When the git commit command is run, by default it only looks
   at this staging area, so git add is used to craft what 
   exactly you would like your next commit snapshot to look like.
   
   git add -A - {stages all}

   git add . - {stages new and modified, without deleted}
  
   git add -u - {stages modified and deleted,without new}

#6 Git Checkout Command

   Updates files in the working tree to match the version in 
   the index or the specified tree. If no pathspec was given, 
   git checkout will also update HEAD to set the specified 
   branch as the current branch.
  
   git checkout - {switch branches or restore working tree files}
  
   git checkout -f - {all}

#7 Git Logs Command 
 
   List commits that are reachable by following the parent 
   links from the given commit(s), but exclude commits that are 
   reachable from the one(s) given with a ^ in front of them. 
   The output is given in reverse chronological order by default

   git log - {show commit logs}

   git log -p -(number of commit) - {to see recently commits}

#8 Git Diff Command

   Show changes between the working tree and the index or a 
   tree, changes between the index and a tree, changes between 
   two trees, changes resulting from a merge, changes between 
   two blob objects, or changes between two files on disk.

   git diff - {show changes between commits,commit and working 
               tree, etc}

   git diff --staged - {comparing working to staging area}

#9 Removing File

   The git rm command is used to remove files from the staging
   area and working directory for Git. It is similar to git 
   add in that it staged a removal of a file for the next commit
   
   git rm (filename) - {Remove files from the working tree and from the 
             staging area}
   
   git rm --cached (filename) - {File only remove from staging 
                                 area}
#10 Checking Status
    
    Displays paths that have differences between the index file 
    and the current HEAD commit, paths that have differences 
    between the working tree and the index file, and paths 
    in the working tree that are not tracked by Git 
    (and are not ignored by gitignore).
   
    git status - {Show the working tree status}  

    git status -s - {short for git status}
    
#11 Ignoring files and directory
  
    A gitignore file specifies intentionally untracked files 
    that Git should ignore. Files already tracked by Git are 
    not affected; see the NOTES below for details.
    
    gitignore - {Specifies intentionally untracked files to 
                 ignore}

#12 Branches 
 
    A branch represents an independent line of development. 
    Branches serve as an abstraction for the edit/stage/commit 
    process. You can think of them as a way to request a brand 
    new working directory, staging area, and project history. 
    New commits are recorded in the history for the current 
    branch, which results in a fork in the history of the project.
    
    git branch --list - {Listing a branches}

    git branch (branch_name) - {Creating a branch}
    
    git branch -d (branch_name) - {Deleting a branch}

#13 Github 

    GitHub, Inc. is a provider of Internet hosting for software 
    development and version control using Git. It offers the 
    distributed version control and source code management 
    (SCM) functionality of Git, plus its own features. 
    It provides access control and several collaboration 
    features such as bug tracking, feature requests, 
    task management, continuous integration, and wikis for 
    every project.

#14 Remote Repository
   
    Remote repositories are versions of your project that are 
    hosted on the Internet or network somewhere. 
    You can have several of them, each of which generally is 
    either read-only or read/write for you.

#15 Pushing repo from local repository to remote repository
 
    The git push command is used to upload local repository 
    content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer 
    commits from your local repository to a remote repo.

    git push (origin master) -  {origin is by default remote and 
                                 master is by default branch}

#16 Pulling repo form remote repository to local repository
 
    The git pull command is used to fetch and download content 
    from a remote repository and immediately update the 
    local repository to match that content.    
    
    git pull - {by default}

#17 Cloning repo 
    
    The git clone command is used to copy an existing Git 
    repository from a server to the local machine.
